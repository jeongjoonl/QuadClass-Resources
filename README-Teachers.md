# The Quadcopter Class

* 'labs' has all the labs.  The write ups reference the starter repos they use.
* The remote control is here: https://github.com/NVSL/Quadcopter-Remote
* The test stand is here: https://github.com/NVSL/PID-Test-Stand
* `Eagle` has the pre-built parts library, CAM files, and design rule files to use with Eagle.

## Using Github Classroom

Here's one way to use github classroom to run this course.

1.  Create an organization for the course.  Reuse the same org year-to-year.
2.  Create new assignments for each year (e.g., "Building eagle Parts 2018").  Student repos are grouped by assignment, so if you reuse last year's you'll see all their repos too.
3.  When you create new assignments for a year, disable the invitation link for the old assignments so students don't accidently use them.

## More Information for Instructors

I'm happy to share all the materials for the course (including
solutions to the labs) with other instructors.  Please contact swanson@cs.ucsd.edu.
